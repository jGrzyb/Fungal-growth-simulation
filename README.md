# Fungal-growth-simulation

This is program that simulates fungal growth based on various parameters and substrat availability. 

### Run **gui.py** to start application.

You can define parameters such as:
- Grid size
- Avarage substrate availability
- substrate transport cost
- Step number
- file name
- number of hyphaes

For every Hyphae you can define parameters such as:
- probability of forward movement
- probability of turning
- substrate consumption in one step
- movement probability lower bound
- hyphae creation cost
- initial hyphae direction

When all parameters are set, run simulation and wait till the end of the simulation. You will see two gifs representing fungal growth and substrate consumption.

These files are saved as gifs in program's current location.
